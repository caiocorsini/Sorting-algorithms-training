# Sorting-algorithms-training
A simple code where write famous sorting algorithms, from simple ones to more complex ones. 
Done purely for education and study purposes. 
Includes a time measurement to compare the speed of each one.

# To do list
There is still a lot of work to be done at the time of posting. I am still quite a beginner, so it might take a while.
I am still going to add:

- More sorting algorithms
- Comments and documentation
- Optimization of overall code
- Bug fixes
